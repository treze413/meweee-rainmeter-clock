# MeWeee’s Clock (Rainmeter Skin)

A minimal Rainmeter countdown clock and progress bar tracking days, weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds.

This skin was created as a persistent layer on top of my screen — a constant reminder that time is limited and that progress toward a defined outcome cannot be postponed. It is intentionally pressurising: a daily signal to act, commit, and move forward with urgency and grit.

The guiding question behind it is simple:

“If you keep living the way you are, what will your life look like in 20 years?”

I built this as a personal companion for MeWeee, a project I committed to pursue within a strict, self-imposed time frame (two years). The rule is binary:
if the defined stage is reached, the project evolves to the next level;
if not, it ends in its current form.

This clock exists to remove excuses, reinforce commitment, and make time visible — every day.
